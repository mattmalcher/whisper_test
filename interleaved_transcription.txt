[Customer Service] [0.00s]: Yes,
[Caller] [1.72s]: So did you just hear that message?
[Customer Service] [3.68s]: it did.
[Caller] [4.22s]: Okay.
[Customer Service] [4.50s]: But now
[Caller] [4.54s]: Right.
[Customer Service] [5.10s]: I don't have a British accent.
[Caller] [6.88s]: I actually have to call someone who has an American accent who is living outside the United States because
[Customer Service] [14.46s]: Oh, all right.
[Customer Service] [15.04s]: Fair enough.
[Caller] [15.56s]: of the thing.
[Caller] [16.82s]: What they want is they want American accents for
[Customer Service] [20.00s]: Wow.
[Caller] [21.12s]: their database.
[Caller] [22.38s]: I also could have gone if I
[Customer Service] [24.58s]: All right,
[Caller] [24.64s]: was a native Spanish
[Customer Service] [25.60s]: thanks,
[Caller] [25.94s]: speaker or
[Customer Service] [26.52s]: sir.
[Caller] [26.64s]: a native Tamil speaker or, you know, they have
[Customer Service] [29.50s]: So
[Caller] [29.58s]: this whole list of language,
[Customer Service] [30.70s]: do
[Caller] [31.14s]: but both people on the
[Customer Service] [32.50s]: you
[Caller] [32.68s]: line have
[Customer Service] [33.08s]: have
[Caller] [33.24s]: to have
[Customer Service] [33.62s]: to
[Caller] [33.74s]: the
[Customer Service] [33.90s]: say anything in particular
[Caller] [34.80s]: same native
[Customer Service] [35.16s]: or did
[Caller] [35.44s]: speech.
[Customer Service] [35.48s]: they just want... Okay.
[Caller] [37.36s]: So, yeah, it's kind of an odd thing, but in any case,
[Customer Service] [41.72s]: So
[Caller] [41.74s]: you know, like I said, I
[Customer Service] [43.64s]: do you have to say anything in particular or did they just want...
[Caller] [46.58s]: just had to get your permission to
[Customer Service] [48.48s]: Okay.
[Caller] [48.54s]: record it.
[Caller] [49.80s]: And after that, basically what they want is whatever we happen to be saying so that they can get random bits.
[Caller] [57.20s]: You know, the idea is to get random bits of speech for this.
[Caller] [61.10s]: And for some reason, they want some of it.
[Caller] [65.92s]: They actually have three different programs, and one
[Customer Service] [70.00s]: Well, this
[Caller] [70.34s]: of
[Customer Service] [70.42s]: is an
[Caller] [70.52s]: them
[Customer Service] [70.84s]: extremely
[Caller] [71.04s]: involves
[Customer Service] [71.30s]: good
[Caller] [71.98s]: you
[Customer Service] [72.02s]: line.
[Caller] [73.20s]: have to call within the United States
[Customer Service] [74.95s]: Because oftentimes you'd get a satellite
[Caller] [75.06s]: and
[Customer Service] [75.07s]: line which would be very choppy.
[Caller] [75.24s]: one of them you have to call outside the United States.
[Caller] [79.00s]: And
[Customer Service] [79.50s]: So I wonder if they're trying to do speech
[Caller] [79.90s]: that's
[Customer Service] [80.08s]: recognition over phone lines.
[Customer Service] [84.50s]: Hmm.
[Customer Service] [89.50s]: Okay.
[Caller] [93.44s]: part of what they're trying to do, yeah.
[Customer Service] [95.48s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [95.98s]: They want to work on speech recognition and apparently
[Customer Service] [99.50s]: Well,
[Caller] [99.86s]: also on digitizing.
[Customer Service] [103.90s]: you'll have to have them get you to call me back during midday sometime when they're using satellites or something.
[Customer Service] [105.76s]: Well, you'll have to have them get you to call me back during midday sometime when they're using satellites
[Caller] [109.00s]: Well,
[Customer Service] [109.22s]: or something.
[Customer Service] [109.55s]: But anyway.
[Customer Service] [115.10s]: Okay.
[Caller] [115.46s]: this just happened to be the first time that, because what you do here is you dial an 800 number.
[Caller] [121.50s]: And
[Customer Service] [122.22s]: Okay.
[Caller] [122.64s]: yesterday during the day I tried
[Customer Service] [124.60s]: Okay.
[Caller] [124.80s]: to do that when it was time that you might be home and I was actually up and awake.
[Caller] [133.00s]: And
[Customer Service] [133.06s]: Right,
[Caller] [133.48s]: it
[Customer Service] [133.48s]: right.
[Caller] [134.24s]: didn't
[Customer Service] [134.50s]: Right,
[Caller] [135.10s]: work and then I just happened to still be up at this point.
[Caller] [138.82s]: I said, well, I'll see if I can
[Customer Service] [140.48s]: right.
[Caller] [140.74s]: get through on the 800 number now.
[Caller] [142.72s]: I did.
[Customer Service] [143.74s]: Oh, wow.
[Caller] [145.20s]: So anyway, how are you doing these days?
[Caller] [147.42s]: Things
[Customer Service] [147.70s]: Things are
[Caller] [147.96s]: are
[Customer Service] [148.06s]: going
[Caller] [148.18s]: going very
[Customer Service] [148.32s]: very
[Caller] [148.66s]: well.
[Customer Service] [148.66s]: well.
[Customer Service] [149.50s]: I think I had mentioned before that there's a company now that I'm working with which is very much just myself and Chris.
[Customer Service] [159.50s]: And
[Caller] [159.70s]: Oh.
[Customer Service] [160.00s]: that...oh,
[Caller] [161.06s]: No, you had to mention that.
[Customer Service] [162.44s]: okay.
[Caller] [163.16s]: You told me that you were leaving
[Customer Service] [164.94s]: Well,
[Caller] [165.20s]: the company that you were at and you were entertaining offers and you were doing a lot of work.
[Customer Service] [170.34s]: it seemed to
[Caller] [170.50s]: So,
[Customer Service] [170.50s]: make sense since I had a
[Caller] [172.34s]: yeah, I'm
[Customer Service] [172.38s]: client who just kind of set up my
[Caller] [174.02s]: just trying to get through
[Customer Service] [174.10s]: own
[Caller] [174.12s]: on the 800 number.
[Customer Service] [174.26s]: company.
[Customer Service] [174.94s]: So
[Caller] [175.08s]: I'm
[Customer Service] [176.06s]: things
[Caller] [176.48s]: not going to do it again.
[Caller] [176.60s]: I'm just going
[Customer Service] [176.80s]: are going
[Caller] [177.06s]: to do
[Customer Service] [177.12s]: extremely well.
[Caller] [178.22s]: it again.
[Caller] [178.50s]: So, anyway, how are you doing
[Customer Service] [179.50s]: So I had one
[Caller] [179.58s]: these
[Customer Service] [179.74s]: client
[Caller] [179.82s]: days?
[Caller] [179.97s]: Things
[Customer Service] [180.02s]: who said that he'd
[Caller] [180.88s]: are
[Customer Service] [180.94s]: pay me a minimum amount,
[Caller] [181.92s]: going very well.
[Customer Service] [182.36s]: you know,
[Caller] [183.42s]: You told me that
[Customer Service] [184.50s]: there
[Caller] [184.52s]: you
[Customer Service] [184.52s]: would
[Caller] [184.54s]: were
[Customer Service] [184.54s]: be a minimum amount
[Caller] [184.64s]: leaving the
[Customer Service] [184.66s]: of
[Caller] [184.68s]: company that you were at and you were entertaining offers
[Customer Service] [184.86s]: work of about a
[Caller] [186.38s]: and
[Customer Service] [186.54s]: day a week
[Caller] [186.88s]: you were
[Customer Service] [186.94s]: for
[Caller] [187.02s]: doing a
[Customer Service] [187.16s]: the next
[Caller] [187.42s]: lot
[Customer Service] [187.50s]: two,
[Caller] [187.58s]: of
[Customer Service] [187.80s]: three years
[Caller] [188.48s]: work.
[Caller] [188.96s]: So, anyway,
[Customer Service] [189.50s]: which is
[Caller] [189.54s]: how
[Customer Service] [189.54s]: sufficient
[Caller] [189.56s]: are you
[Customer Service] [189.62s]: to pay all my
[Caller] [190.02s]: doing
[Customer Service] [190.14s]: bills.
[Caller] [190.18s]: these days?
[Caller] [191.22s]: Things
[Customer Service] [191.32s]: And so
[Caller] [191.52s]: are going very
[Customer Service] [191.62s]: I
[Caller] [191.66s]: well.
[Customer Service] [191.72s]: decided that it would make sense to do this.
[Caller] [193.94s]: You told me that you were leaving the company that you
[Customer Service] [195.00s]: And
[Caller] [195.44s]: were at and
[Customer Service] [195.76s]: I've been
[Caller] [196.24s]: you
[Customer Service] [196.34s]: getting
[Caller] [196.40s]: were entertaining offers and
[Customer Service] [196.56s]: substantially
[Caller] [196.82s]: you were doing a lot
[Customer Service] [197.00s]: more work
[Caller] [197.24s]: of work.
[Customer Service] [197.36s]: than that.
[Caller] [199.08s]: So, anyway,
[Customer Service] [199.50s]: So
[Caller] [199.62s]: how are you doing these days?
[Caller] [201.22s]: Things are going very well.
[Caller] [201.98s]: You
[Customer Service] [202.74s]: I'm
[Caller] [203.40s]: told me that you were leaving the company that
[Customer Service] [205.48s]: quite
[Caller] [205.50s]: you
[Customer Service] [205.50s]: pleased.
[Caller] [205.52s]: were
[Customer Service] [205.52s]: So
[Caller] [205.54s]: at
[Customer Service] [205.54s]: I
[Caller] [205.56s]: and
[Customer Service] [205.56s]: have
[Caller] [205.58s]: you
[Customer Service] [205.58s]: a
[Caller] [205.60s]: were
[Customer Service] [205.60s]: bunch
[Caller] [205.62s]: doing
[Customer Service] [205.62s]: of
[Caller] [205.64s]: a
[Customer Service] [205.64s]: work
[Caller] [205.66s]: lot
[Customer Service] [205.66s]: I
[Caller] [205.68s]: of
[Customer Service] [205.68s]: need
[Caller] [205.70s]: work.
[Customer Service] [205.70s]: to
[Caller] [205.72s]: So,
[Customer Service] [205.74s]: do on
[Caller] [206.14s]: anyway, how are you
[Customer Service] [206.74s]: my
[Caller] [207.24s]: doing these days?
[Customer Service] [207.40s]: glass this year.
[Caller] [208.66s]: Things are going very well.
[Caller] [209.02s]: You
[Customer Service] [209.50s]: I've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time.
[Caller] [212.02s]: told me that you were leaving the company that you were at and you were doing a lot of work.
[Caller] [212.68s]: So, anyway, how are you doing these days?
[Caller] [214.60s]: Things are
[Customer Service] [214.90s]: But it
[Caller] [215.02s]: going very well.
[Customer Service] [215.54s]: should come out this year.
[Caller] [217.62s]: You told me that you were leaving the company that you were at and you were doing a lot of work.
[Caller] [219.52s]: So, anyway, how are you doing these days?
[Caller] [222.80s]: Things are going very well.
[Caller] [223.48s]: You told me that you were leaving the company that you were at and you were doing a lot of work.
[Customer Service] [225.48s]: Yep.
[Customer Service] [225.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [226.00s]: I don't see the finances occurring for a while.
[Caller] [231.14s]: Actually, right at the moment, finances are not going real well, but I'm working on that one.
[Caller] [237.90s]: It's just...the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up related to a couple of burglaries that I had.
[Customer Service] [251.22s]: Oh, heart.
[Caller] [252.30s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [252.36s]: Heart.
[Caller] [253.32s]: Yeah, but... Not a whole lot I can do about that now.
[Customer Service] [257.96s]: Indeed.
[Customer Service] [258.64s]: Indeed.
[Caller] [258.66s]: I have to deal with the situation.
[Caller] [261.22s]: So, that's what I'm doing.
[Caller] [262.78s]: But,
[Customer Service] [262.98s]: Good.
[Caller] [264.96s]: anyway,
[Customer Service] [265.00s]: Oh, wow.
[Caller] [266.94s]: one of the main reasons that I've been such a
[Customer Service] [269.50s]: Oh,
[Caller] [270.14s]: pathetic correspondent has been work.
[Caller] [273.02s]: I've actually been doing a lot of it.
[Customer Service] [275.48s]: okay.
[Customer Service] [276.12s]: Impressive.
[Caller] [276.14s]: And I turned in my master's thesis
[Customer Service] [279.50s]: Impressive.
[Caller] [279.52s]: back in May.
[Caller] [281.00s]: I'm actually presently working on several articles from
[Customer Service] [288.24s]: Impressive.
[Caller] [289.04s]: it.
[Caller] [289.84s]: Yeah,
[Customer Service] [290.00s]: Yep.
[Caller] [290.32s]: actually it turns out that one thing, one little bit
[Customer Service] [294.93s]: Yep.
[Caller] [295.02s]: in what I was doing is going to turn out to be very important to me.
[Caller] [299.56s]: And
[Customer Service] [299.92s]: Yep.
[Caller] [301.12s]: from what I have been reading in the literature, one very
[Customer Service] [304.72s]: Yep.
[Caller] [305.00s]: annoying thing about all of this is my advisor's been in France for a year.
[Caller] [309.36s]: And this
[Customer Service] [310.36s]: Yep.
[Caller] [310.44s]: made
[Customer Service] [310.48s]: Yep.
[Customer Service] [310.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [310.62s]: writing my thesis very annoying
[Customer Service] [311.80s]: Yep.
[Caller] [312.28s]: because there wasn't much discussion.
[Customer Service] [314.84s]: Yep.
[Customer Service] [315.48s]: Yep.
[Caller] [315.50s]: But,
[Customer Service] [316.00s]: Yep.
[Customer Service] [316.54s]: Yep.
[Customer Service] [316.76s]: Yep.
[Caller] [319.22s]: anyway, I had been kind of telling him that from my reading of the literature, I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique.
[Caller] [333.00s]: And
[Customer Service] [333.40s]: Mm-hmm.
[Caller] [333.96s]: it made one type of solution occur which was seen experimentally, but none of the other models had.
[Customer Service] [345.98s]: Yep.
[Caller] [346.64s]: Basically, I'm looking at multi-mode lasers.
[Caller] [350.88s]: And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti-phase states where if you look at the total intensity of
[Customer Service] [361.96s]: Uh-huh.
[Caller] [362.20s]: the laser, you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency.
[Customer Service] [368.36s]: Yep.
[Caller] [368.50s]: If
[Customer Service] [368.70s]: Okay.
[Caller] [369.60s]: you separate out the different modes of the laser and
[Customer Service] [374.18s]: Mm-hmm.
[Caller] [374.30s]: look at one of those,
[Customer Service] [375.50s]: Okay.
[Caller] [376.02s]: you get more than one frequency.
[Caller] [379.24s]: So what's happening is the modes are oscillating out of
[Customer Service] [382.80s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [383.02s]: phase so that they completely mask each other.
[Caller] [387.00s]: And you can find oscillations
[Customer Service] [387.20s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [387.62s]: on these other frequencies.
[Caller] [392.02s]: And with a pretty simple model, you can find that frequency in a transient, but you can't find that
[Customer Service] [401.00s]: Okay.
[Caller] [401.16s]: frequency in a driven frequency.
[Caller] [404.51s]: You can't find so that it will sustain that
[Customer Service] [407.54s]: Okay.
[Caller] [407.84s]: frequency.
[Customer Service] [408.06s]: Yep.
[Caller] [409.28s]: So that particular frequency,
[Customer Service] [410.84s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [411.32s]: according to most models, damps out very quickly.
[Caller] [415.00s]: And so you shouldn't actually really be able to ever see it.
[Customer Service] [418.44s]: Got
[Caller] [418.50s]: The only thing is
[Customer Service] [419.46s]: it.
[Caller] [419.78s]: that when
[Customer Service] [420.28s]: Got it.
[Caller] [420.46s]: you do the experiment,
[Customer Service] [421.48s]: I see.
[Customer Service] [421.52s]: Okay.
[Caller] [421.60s]: you see it.
[Caller] [424.12s]: So I found a
[Customer Service] [426.24s]: Yep.
[Caller] [427.16s]: simple modification of the original formula which unfortunately
[Customer Service] [430.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [430.88s]: makes the solution horrendously nasty and in most cases insoluble.
[Caller] [438.82s]: But
[Customer Service] [439.04s]: Yep.
[Caller] [439.42s]: it gives a driving term.
[Caller] [443.00s]: So
[Customer Service] [443.04s]: Oh, okay.
[Caller] [443.52s]: it actually creates a
[Customer Service] [445.98s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [446.24s]: situation where you get the right sort of answer.
[Caller] [449.08s]: You just can't always write it down very quickly.
[Customer Service] [456.14s]: Exactly.
[Customer Service] [458.54s]: Exactly.
[Customer Service] [460.50s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [461.14s]: Which is kind of interesting considering that that's not really my thing.
[Customer Service] [466.36s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [468.52s]: Being an experimentalist is not a theory.
[Customer Service] [471.82s]: Exactly.
[Customer Service] [476.00s]: Yep.
[Caller] [477.74s]: Actually,
[Customer Service] [480.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [480.80s]: I'm not sure if we're shooting for... I think optic
[Customer Service] [486.08s]: Yep.
[Caller] [486.16s]: letters is probably the one that we're shooting for
[Customer Service] [490.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [490.52s]: or else perhaps.
[Caller] [493.00s]: So I don't think it's quite that significant with the FISREV letters.
[Customer Service] [498.66s]: Yep.
[Caller] [499.28s]: But we want to write a letter and then a couple articles.
[Customer Service] [504.72s]: Yep.
[Caller] [506.04s]: And
[Customer Service] [506.12s]: Oh, okay.
[Caller] [506.66s]: I don't know how much you know about scientific literature, but letters are much more prestigious than articles.
[Customer Service] [514.78s]: Oh, I didn't realize that.
[Customer Service] [516.31s]: Okay.
[Caller] [517.02s]: Yeah, so that's why it's actually a big deal.
[Customer Service] [520.86s]: Yep.
[Caller] [521.00s]: Writing a couple articles based on your master's thesis is not at all unusual in physics.
[Caller] [527.20s]: And
[Customer Service] [527.54s]: Yep.
[Caller] [529.26s]: it's the fact
[Customer Service] [530.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [530.56s]: that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all.
[Caller] [534.54s]: And what's actually kind
[Customer Service] [536.08s]: Yep.
[Caller] [536.20s]: of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant.
[Customer Service] [540.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [540.86s]: And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down.
[Customer Service] [547.64s]: Yep.
[Caller] [547.80s]: And people have been seeing... You know, people see the
[Customer Service] [551.00s]: Yep.
[Caller] [551.10s]: anti-phase motion and it's true, they do in the transient.
[Caller] [554.50s]: And I was having a lot
[Customer Service] [555.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [555.66s]: of trouble getting a concept that all of the literature has this frequency in the transient and
[Customer Service] [562.26s]: Yep.
[Caller] [563.00s]: not driven.
[Caller] [564.50s]: And
[Customer Service] [565.76s]: Yep.
[Caller] [566.12s]: what happened was after I had turned in my thesis, but before
[Customer Service] [570.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [570.74s]: I saw Neil again, he went to a conference in Rochester.
[Caller] [575.00s]: And there,
[Customer Service] [576.00s]: Oh,
[Caller] [576.44s]: this was a big issue among the
[Customer Service] [577.82s]: cool.
[Caller] [578.06s]: people who were doing the work, that
[Customer Service] [580.50s]: Oh, just a second.
[Caller] [580.70s]: their models couldn't show this at the driven frequency, yet their experiments showed it
[Customer Service] [586.00s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [586.10s]: at the driven frequency.
[Caller] [587.90s]: And so Neil then, like
[Customer Service] [590.72s]: Cool.
[Caller] [590.88s]: a week later, came to
[Customer Service] [592.04s]: Cool.
[Caller] [592.16s]: Bryn Mawr and he said, hey, lol, we've got to write this up.
[Customer Service] [596.08s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [596.16s]: And I was like, well, I've been telling you that, Neil.
[Caller] [600.00s]: So that's
[Customer Service] [601.52s]: Cool.
[Customer Service] [602.28s]: Cool.
[Caller] [603.42s]: mostly the sort of stuff that I'm spending a lot of time on now.
[Customer Service] [607.44s]: Well, it'll look good on your TV.
[Customer Service] [609.18s]: You're going to make it look good.
[Customer Service] [610.56s]: So you might as well spend the time.
[Caller] [613.70s]: Yes, well, definitely
[Customer Service] [615.66s]: No,
[Caller] [616.34s]: worth doing.
[Caller] [618.34s]: And I would have been spending more time on
[Customer Service] [620.54s]: yeah.
[Caller] [620.62s]: it if it weren't for dealing with the burglary issues that I've been dealing with.
[Customer Service] [625.24s]: So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park?
[Caller] [627.78s]: Yes.
[Customer Service] [628.76s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [630.28s]: The
[Customer Service] [630.50s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [630.60s]: thing is that this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to.
[Customer Service] [635.94s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [636.02s]: It's not a question of whether or not that was easy.
[Caller] [641.90s]: It was just that no one really
[Customer Service] [643.38s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [643.44s]: knew it was worth breaking into.
[Caller] [646.80s]: And so the problem is that now they've found out that it's worth breaking into.
[Customer Service] [651.20s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [651.34s]: Yep.
[Caller] [652.04s]: And unfortunately, well, it's kind of odd.
[Caller] [655.10s]: They've stolen very weird
[Customer Service] [656.62s]: Yep.
[Caller] [656.92s]: things for the most part.
[Caller] [659.14s]: As far as, you know,
[Customer Service] [660.98s]: Yep.
[Caller] [661.28s]: the first time they broke in, what they stole was just
[Customer Service] [665.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [665.74s]: bizarre, mostly worthless stuff.
[Caller] [670.72s]: And the
[Customer Service] [671.84s]: Yep.
[Caller] [672.70s]: most worthwhile thing as far as monetary
[Customer Service] [676.00s]: Yep.
[Caller] [676.36s]: value went that they stole was the preamplifier of my stereo.
[Customer Service] [680.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [681.26s]: Unfortunately, because of the nice preamplifier, it had an off-board
[Customer Service] [685.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [685.80s]: power supply, which they didn't steal, which makes the thing that they stole absolutely worthless.
[Customer Service] [693.02s]: Huh.
[Customer Service] [696.52s]: She's gone.
[Customer Service] [697.30s]: She's gone.
[Customer Service] [701.00s]: I'm going to go to the off-board amplifier.
[Caller] [702.62s]: Actually, no, all they stole the second time was my bike, which
[Customer Service] [707.04s]: Huh.
[Caller] [707.54s]: was actually where the major problem came in.
[Caller] [711.06s]: The problem
[Customer Service] [711.16s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [711.42s]: is
[Customer Service] [711.78s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [711.84s]: that
[Customer Service] [712.20s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [712.46s]: I suddenly had no transportation, and so I then had to go bike
[Customer Service] [717.44s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [717.46s]: hunting and eventually get another bike.
[Caller] [719.53s]: That cost me a lot of time.
[Customer Service] [723.18s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [724.82s]: Spending a lot of time hunting for bikes, getting one purchased and then having to
[Customer Service] [731.48s]: Yep.
[Customer Service] [731.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [731.60s]: go get it.
[Caller] [732.50s]: That's dealt with at least.
[Customer Service] [735.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [737.54s]: That's at least dealt
[Customer Service] [740.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [740.74s]: with.
[Caller] [740.96s]: Now I just have to work on the financial aspect of all of this.
[Caller] [745.68s]: At
[Customer Service] [746.62s]: Yep.
[Caller] [746.76s]: least during the summer I can actually,
[Customer Service] [751.00s]: Okay.
[Caller] [751.98s]: according to the stipulations of my grant,
[Customer Service] [755.66s]: Okay.
[Caller] [756.06s]: of my fellowship, I can actually earn money.
[Caller] [759.74s]: So that's
[Customer Service] [760.77s]: Okay.
[Caller] [762.18s]: an advantage is that I'm allowed to earn money now, at least.
[Customer Service] [767.22s]: So, why do they want you not to earn money while you're... I suppose that they just wanted to dedicate all your time to the education and the food.
[Caller] [776.72s]: Yeah, the idea behind that is that the fellowship is
[Customer Service] [781.00s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [781.22s]: paying for my schoolwork and for my
[Customer Service] [785.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [787.24s]: stipend.
[Caller] [788.19s]: Therefore, I should be living off of that and spending my time doing some work rather than working
[Customer Service] [796.48s]: Yep.
[Caller] [796.50s]: at
[Customer Service] [796.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [797.04s]: something that seems funny.
[Caller] [799.60s]: That's part of the agreement is that I'm not supposed to work.
[Caller] [803.50s]: Actually,
[Customer Service] [804.14s]: Yep.
[Customer Service] [806.00s]: Yep.
[Caller] [806.92s]: something that I found out this year that I wish I had known last year that
[Customer Service] [810.64s]: Yep.
[Caller] [810.76s]: is interesting, and I guess I haven't really told you about this one, is that it turns out that the educational grant part of my fellowship that
[Customer Service] [821.24s]: Yep.
[Customer Service] [821.32s]: Yep.
[Caller] [821.92s]: is supposed to go toward tuition can be used on other things if
[Customer Service] [825.86s]: Yep.
[Caller] [826.26s]: I don't need it all for tuition.
[Caller] [828.12s]: And since I've taken all of the courses
[Customer Service] [831.15s]: Oh,
[Caller] [831.60s]: that
[Customer Service] [831.96s]: okay.
[Caller] [831.98s]: they offer at Bryn Mawr in physics, I have
[Customer Service] [835.62s]: Yep.
[Caller] [836.30s]: been
[Customer Service] [837.08s]: Yep.
[Caller] [837.34s]: registered
[Customer Service] [837.62s]: Yep.
[Caller] [838.08s]: under continuing education, which costs $350 a term as opposed to several thousand for a
[Customer Service] [845.80s]: Yep.
[Caller] [845.96s]: class.
[Customer Service] [846.12s]: Oh, okay.
[Customer Service] [847.00s]: Yep.
[Customer Service] [847.30s]: Yep.
[Caller] [847.64s]: So
[Customer Service] [847.66s]: Yep.
[Caller] [847.80s]: I've
[Customer Service] [847.96s]: Yep.
[Caller] [848.06s]: had all this extra money in the same thing.
[Customer Service] [850.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [851.12s]: And so actually, I guess, yeah, I had, I
[Customer Service] [855.50s]: Yep.
[Caller] [855.94s]: didn't have my computer last time that I would have talked to it.
[Customer Service] [863.04s]: Oh, do you have an internet address?
[Customer Service] [865.08s]: Because we've got an internet link up here.
[Caller] [867.12s]: Oh, you finally do.
[Caller] [868.38s]: Cool.
[Customer Service] [869.20s]: Yeah,
[Caller] [869.22s]: Yes.
[Customer Service] [869.58s]: well, it wasn't anything I did, but...
[Caller] [871.92s]: I have two of them.
[Customer Service] [873.38s]: All right, well,
[Caller] [874.00s]: The
[Customer Service] [874.04s]: let's hear them.
[Caller] [875.96s]: best one to use would be
[Customer Service] [878.18s]: Okay.
[Caller] [878.32s]: L. Carson at
[Customer Service] [883.20s]: Yep.
[Caller] [883.28s]: cc.computersim.brynmawr.edu.
[Customer Service] [886.16s]: PC.
[Customer Service] [888.34s]: Okay.
[Customer Service] [890.86s]: Okay.
[Customer Service] [897.80s]: Two words.
[Caller] [899.00s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [901.54s]: No.
[Customer Service] [901.54s]: And burn our space between us.
[Caller] [903.30s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [905.09s]: Well,
[Customer Service] [905.50s]: I don't know anything about the internet.
[Caller] [906.96s]: yeah.
[Caller] [909.52s]: Yeah, well, the thing is
[Customer Service] [910.50s]: Well,
[Caller] [910.76s]: that every other country in the world will end with a country code.
[Caller] [914.48s]: Except for the U.S. And
[Customer Service] [916.14s]: of course, except for the US.
[Customer Service] [918.76s]: Yeah, it's
[Caller] [919.24s]: in
[Customer Service] [919.24s]: like...
[Caller] [920.10s]: the U.S., they
[Customer Service] [921.00s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [921.18s]: all end with NET, GOV, COM, or EDU.
[Caller] [925.54s]: Depending on
[Customer Service] [925.56s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [925.58s]: where they are.
[Caller] [927.48s]: So that's an educational one.
[Caller] [930.84s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [934.20s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [934.38s]: Just
[Customer Service] [934.82s]: I suppose the commercial
[Caller] [935.40s]: NET.
[Customer Service] [935.70s]: government or...
[Caller] [939.56s]: It's
[Customer Service] [939.64s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [940.02s]: just a, it's a NET service.
[Caller] [941.48s]: An actual Internet service.
[Caller] [943.50s]: Those seldom actually have a
[Customer Service] [944.04s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [945.10s]: person that you live
[Customer Service] [946.00s]: Okay.
[Caller] [946.14s]: with.
[Caller] [948.50s]: I don't think any of those,
[Customer Service] [951.86s]: Okay.
[Caller] [952.00s]: but I'm not sure.
[Caller] [953.06s]: Yeah, well, then I will have to send you junk mail over the Internet.
[Customer Service] [959.22s]: Well...
[Caller] [959.28s]: Yeah, that would be a good thing to do.
[Customer Service] [964.46s]: Oh, in fact, let me get our address.
[Customer Service] [967.62s]: So I can give you...
[Caller] [968.82s]: The underscore mail.
[Caller] [970.24s]: The
[Customer Service] [971.00s]: Chris,
[Caller] [971.20s]: underscore
[Customer Service] [971.50s]: what's your internet address?
[Caller] [973.18s]: mail.
[Caller] [973.99s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [975.60s]: What's your internet
[Caller] [976.03s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [976.40s]: address?
[Caller] [977.76s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [980.12s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [982.84s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [985.10s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [985.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [987.99s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [990.19s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [992.70s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [993.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [995.52s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [999.10s]: Uh-huh.
[Caller] [999.92s]: Okay.
[Customer Service] [1002.60s]: Oh, that's it.
[Caller] [1003.44s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1005.38s]: I
[Customer Service] [1005.50s]: Oh,
[Caller] [1005.82s]: recognize the .UK.
[Caller] [1008.12s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1008.28s]: indeed.
[Customer Service] [1008.72s]: Indeed, it's a country.
[Customer Service] [1009.84s]: It's one over here in Europe.
[Caller] [1013.02s]: Well,
[Customer Service] [1013.28s]: Or kind of a pseudo country.
[Caller] [1015.50s]: well,
[Customer Service] [1016.00s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1016.44s]: it's interesting because org and
[Customer Service] [1020.50s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1020.84s]: AC for academic, I know they use there.
[Caller] [1026.00s]: And a lot of
[Customer Service] [1026.76s]: Okay,
[Caller] [1026.84s]: other countries don't even
[Customer Service] [1027.72s]: yeah.
[Caller] [1027.98s]: use that.
[Caller] [1029.56s]: You'll just have,
[Customer Service] [1030.62s]: Yeah,
[Caller] [1030.94s]: you know, it'll be something.
[Caller] [1032.44s]: IT in
[Customer Service] [1035.38s]: yeah.
[Caller] [1035.56s]: Italy.
[Customer Service] [1037.10s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1037.66s]: They won't even have an extra code to tell you anything about the place.
[Customer Service] [1041.98s]: Yeah, yeah.
[Caller] [1045.20s]: But England
[Customer Service] [1045.66s]: Okay,
[Caller] [1046.02s]: seems to be pretty consistent about having an extra code in there.
[Customer Service] [1050.96s]: exactly.
[Caller] [1051.00s]: So that's actually similar to US.
[Caller] [1054.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1054.92s]: So you can at least figure out what it is.
[Caller] [1057.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1058.70s]: So...
[Caller] [1059.44s]: Do you guys have full access to the World Wide Web as well?
[Caller] [1063.16s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1063.56s]: Oh, yes, yes.
[Caller] [1064.50s]: That's
[Customer Service] [1066.00s]: Oh, indeed.
[Customer Service] [1068.18s]: Indeed.
[Customer Service] [1070.50s]: Oh,
[Caller] [1072.92s]: another
[Customer Service] [1073.08s]: it's...
[Caller] [1073.22s]: one of the things that my educational grant is paying for.
[Customer Service] [1077.76s]: Ah, damn
[Caller] [1079.00s]: Because
[Customer Service] [1079.22s]: it.
[Caller] [1079.44s]: through Bryn Mawr, I don't have World
[Customer Service] [1081.18s]: Well,
[Caller] [1081.38s]: Wide Web access.
[Caller] [1082.78s]: So I bought that
[Customer Service] [1083.60s]: I had been...
[Caller] [1083.86s]: on my own, which
[Customer Service] [1084.68s]: I've
[Caller] [1084.76s]: is why I
[Customer Service] [1085.14s]: read a
[Caller] [1085.18s]: have,
[Customer Service] [1085.18s]: book
[Caller] [1085.44s]: I
[Customer Service] [1085.68s]: and I
[Caller] [1085.80s]: do
[Customer Service] [1085.86s]: was
[Caller] [1086.02s]: have another email
[Customer Service] [1086.48s]: like,
[Caller] [1086.90s]: address, but I seldom check the mail.
[Customer Service] [1089.44s]: I'm
[Caller] [1089.50s]: So
[Customer Service] [1089.86s]: going
[Caller] [1090.12s]: it's
[Customer Service] [1090.12s]: to read a
[Caller] [1090.20s]: better
[Customer Service] [1090.44s]: book
[Caller] [1090.46s]: to just send it
[Customer Service] [1091.20s]: about the
[Caller] [1091.28s]: to Bryn
[Customer Service] [1091.48s]: internet.
[Customer Service] [1091.50s]: Well,
[Caller] [1091.74s]: Mawr.
[Customer Service] [1093.94s]: I had been... I've read a book and I was in the midst of writing a letter, but it takes forever to finish a letter sometimes, by... called The Quantum Self, by some woman who got her undergraduate physics degree from MIT and then went to the doctorate in philosophy from Harvard and now she lives over in England.
[Customer Service] [1121.34s]: I'm going to kind of ruin the book, but she talks about
[Caller] [1124.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1124.10s]: both Einstein's
[Caller] [1125.61s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1125.84s]: condensates and
[Caller] [1127.57s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1127.66s]: how you can use those in
[Caller] [1129.62s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1130.78s]: some form
[Caller] [1131.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1132.20s]: if you wanted to at the
[Caller] [1133.78s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1133.86s]: basis for consciousness
[Caller] [1135.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1135.50s]: and then having a state based on top
[Caller] [1137.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1137.72s]: of that.
[Caller] [1139.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1141.00s]: I read a book from Saren,
[Caller] [1141.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1143.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1145.50s]: a
[Caller] [1145.51s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1146.36s]: few months ago, and I was talking
[Caller] [1147.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1147.56s]: to him about it and he said I was completely bolted.
[Caller] [1149.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1150.70s]: But he
[Caller] [1152.54s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1152.80s]: hadn't read her
[Caller] [1153.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1153.76s]: stuff.
[Caller] [1155.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1155.50s]: What he said is, well, all those that I've read about, you know, making those, I'm
[Caller] [1157.60s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1157.68s]: saying,
[Caller] [1159.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1160.50s]: condensates to consciousness, they just don't really... they just kind
[Caller] [1161.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1161.50s]: of make a logical leap in the new and the past.
[Caller] [1163.80s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1165.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1166.00s]: Also, this guy was a complete cynic.
[Caller] [1167.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1169.56s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1170.68s]: He was a pure
[Caller] [1171.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1171.68s]: atheist and it was
[Caller] [1173.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1173.58s]: just depressing to speak to him.
[Caller] [1175.74s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1175.86s]: So eventually I asked him, why haven't you committed
[Caller] [1177.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1177.64s]: suicide yet?
[Caller] [1180.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1180.50s]: And he said something like,
[Caller] [1181.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1181.96s]: well, I enjoy it.
[Customer Service] [1183.06s]: I enjoy what
[Caller] [1183.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1183.58s]: I'm doing at work.
[Customer Service] [1185.50s]: But what do you do?
[Caller] [1185.60s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1185.82s]: I make bigger particles.
[Caller] [1187.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1189.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1192.72s]: So
[Caller] [1193.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1193.64s]: I
[Caller] [1193.67s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1194.66s]: asked him the
[Caller] [1195.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1195.74s]: right question by
[Caller] [1197.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1197.64s]: accident.
[Customer Service] [1198.68s]: I
[Caller] [1199.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1199.72s]: asked him, I think, have you made a double particle yet?
[Caller] [1201.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1202.60s]: And he said, look close,
[Caller] [1203.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1203.74s]: look close, he's made virtual.
[Caller] [1205.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1207.92s]: He
[Caller] [1208.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1208.02s]: said, oh, wow, I don't even know
[Caller] [1209.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1209.52s]: what my question was.
[Caller] [1211.62s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1213.44s]: But
[Caller] [1213.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1213.56s]: at least I succeeded in small talking.
[Caller] [1216.88s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1218.60s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1221.36s]: Sounds a
[Caller] [1221.86s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1221.92s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1222.14s]: bit special, I think.
[Customer Service] [1225.50s]: Sounds
[Caller] [1225.60s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1227.32s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1227.61s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1228.06s]: a bit
[Caller] [1229.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1229.72s]: special, I think.
[Customer Service] [1232.16s]: Sounds a bit special, I think.
[Caller] [1233.80s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1233.90s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1235.50s]: Sounds a bit special,
[Caller] [1236.34s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1237.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1237.68s]: I think.
[Caller] [1242.00s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1244.48s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1245.04s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1245.04s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1245.56s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1246.00s]: Right.
[Caller] [1247.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1249.56s]: Yeah.

[Caller] [1266.28s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1267.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1269.58s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1272.64s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1275.70s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1276.00s]: Oh,
[Caller] [1277.24s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1278.94s]: right.
[Caller] [1279.98s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1280.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1280.50s]: Oh,
[Caller] [1283.28s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1285.44s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1285.93s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1286.14s]: right.
[Customer Service] [1286.42s]: Okay.
[Caller] [1287.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1289.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1292.02s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1293.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1293.66s]: Hmm.
[Customer Service] [1295.48s]: Yeah,
[Caller] [1295.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1295.84s]: yeah, yeah.
[Customer Service] [1296.24s]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Caller] [1299.30s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1301.00s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1301.48s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1301.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1305.58s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1306.42s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1306.44s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1309.18s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1310.94s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1311.72s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1313.94s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1315.36s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1316.12s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1317.14s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1319.24s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1320.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1320.51s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1323.70s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1325.40s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1327.58s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1327.62s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1328.68s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1329.58s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1331.60s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1332.80s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1333.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1335.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1336.06s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1339.24s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1339.68s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1340.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1341.96s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1343.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1345.70s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1345.96s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1349.48s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1351.00s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1352.48s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1352.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1353.58s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1356.01s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1357.00s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1357.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1359.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1360.72s]: Well,
[Caller] [1361.86s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1365.04s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1365.26s]: let me
[Caller] [1365.76s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1366.22s]: send you a letter
[Caller] [1367.98s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1368.04s]: eventually and I'll reference what the book is.
[Caller] [1371.32s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1371.36s]: The
[Caller] [1371.53s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1371.70s]: reason that I liked it is because it was,
[Caller] [1373.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1374.38s]: she was reasonably rigorous
[Caller] [1376.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1376.01s]: from the scientific part.
[Customer Service] [1377.36s]: I
[Caller] [1377.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1377.50s]: mean, there were no formulas or anything in it.
[Caller] [1379.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1380.50s]: And I don't really care about details
[Caller] [1381.60s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1381.80s]: like that.
[Customer Service] [1382.52s]: But
[Caller] [1383.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1383.54s]: she being
[Caller] [1385.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1385.50s]: a philosopher, I guess it was psychology
[Caller] [1387.76s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1388.54s]: and religion.
[Caller] [1389.58s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1390.50s]: There was some really weird
[Caller] [1391.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1391.94s]: combinations.
[Customer Service] [1393.46s]: It was
[Caller] [1393.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1393.66s]: physics and I'm thinking about it.
[Caller] [1395.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1395.50s]: There was religion as one of her sort
[Caller] [1397.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1397.56s]: of majors or degrees or something.
[Customer Service] [1398.86s]: Maybe it was
[Caller] [1399.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1401.40s]: because
[Caller] [1401.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1401.82s]: she viewed it from, well, these are things
[Caller] [1404.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1404.04s]: that you notice when you
[Caller] [1405.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1405.80s]: look at
[Caller] [1407.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1407.80s]: humans and how they interact
[Caller] [1409.60s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1409.82s]: and how they behave.
[Customer Service] [1411.26s]: And
[Caller] [1411.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1412.42s]: then she'd go
[Caller] [1413.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1413.52s]: through and she'd discuss something and she'd say, oh, and this is interesting.
[Caller] [1415.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1416.34s]: It's the current theory in
[Caller] [1417.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1418.64s]: human psychology
[Caller] [1419.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1419.56s]: and such and stuff.
[Customer Service] [1420.62s]: And it kind of
[Caller] [1421.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1421.58s]: matches it.
[Customer Service] [1423.08s]: So
[Caller] [1423.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1423.54s]: she takes it from the standpoint of, well, consciousness has
[Caller] [1425.76s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1425.84s]: to have it has to have these
[Caller] [1427.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1427.58s]: sort of principles that need to have
[Caller] [1429.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1432.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1432.24s]: people who think of the
[Caller] [1433.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1433.64s]: brain as a network of
[Caller] [1435.62s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1436.10s]: neural nodes.
[Customer Service] [1437.42s]: They can't
[Caller] [1437.70s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1438.04s]: explain consciousness, which
[Caller] [1439.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1439.58s]: is it's
[Caller] [1441.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1441.54s]: across it all.
[Customer Service] [1442.18s]: It's unified in a sense.
[Customer Service] [1444.26s]: So
[Caller] [1444.38s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1444.78s]: we don't think in sort of individual little, you know, transactions going on.
[Customer Service] [1448.20s]: In
[Caller] [1448.48s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1448.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1448.68s]: parallel, we think
[Caller] [1449.60s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1449.62s]: it's sort of whole thing.
[Caller] [1451.86s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1451.94s]: And so I'm
[Caller] [1453.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1453.80s]: not explaining it very well.
[Customer Service] [1455.06s]: But she covers
[Caller] [1455.51s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1455.60s]: it from different angles like that and then goes through
[Caller] [1457.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1457.74s]: and describes different physics
[Caller] [1460.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1460.82s]: concepts.
[Caller] [1461.70s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1462.02s]: What was the other one?
[Customer Service] [1463.20s]: There was
[Caller] [1463.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1464.44s]: a Sporless system
[Caller] [1465.62s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1467.08s]: which I
[Caller] [1467.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1467.50s]: think are things like they're
[Caller] [1469.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1470.24s]: kind of halfway between
[Caller] [1471.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1473.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1473.98s]: I guess it's kind of a controlled chaos.
[Customer Service] [1475.66s]: It's
[Caller] [1475.86s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1476.08s]: like world pools
[Caller] [1477.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1477.56s]: in a stream where the
[Caller] [1479.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1480.82s]: system of the
[Caller] [1481.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1481.68s]: world pool is maintained even
[Caller] [1483.52s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1483.52s]: though the component of the world
[Caller] [1485.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1485.50s]: pool, i.e. the water, is constantly changing.
[Caller] [1488.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1489.26s]: And
[Caller] [1489.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1489.58s]: so she pulls a bunch of things together
[Caller] [1491.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1491.82s]: and it seems reasonably rigorous.
[Customer Service] [1493.48s]: But again,
[Caller] [1493.62s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1493.90s]: I wouldn't have said it.
[Customer Service] [1494.88s]: I wasn't reading for
[Caller] [1495.54s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1495.72s]: that.
[Customer Service] [1495.78s]: And then she gets a bit
[Caller] [1497.76s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1497.82s]: philosophical at different parts.
[Caller] [1499.62s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1499.64s]: And she has interesting comments in that section as well.
[Caller] [1501.54s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1503.38s]: She
[Caller] [1503.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1504.30s]: blames every, all
[Caller] [1505.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1505.80s]: the evils of the world on
[Caller] [1507.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1508.02s]: Cartesian,
[Caller] [1509.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1509.74s]: Newtonian, Bordean
[Caller] [1511.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1513.00s]: mindset
[Caller] [1513.56s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1514.12s]: thinking that, well, maybe
[Caller] [1516.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1516.12s]: they were useful but they're
[Caller] [1517.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1517.60s]: leading to degenerations of our society
[Caller] [1519.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1519.68s]: and we need to have a new quantum system.
[Caller] [1521.72s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1522.14s]: So it's a bit of a process as well.
[Caller] [1524.14s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1525.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1528.82s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1531.06s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1531.40s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1532.34s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1532.52s]: Well, I tend to agree with it in
[Caller] [1535.70s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1535.72s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1535.90s]: non-specific senses.
[Caller] [1537.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1538.86s]: I have no
[Caller] [1539.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1539.60s]: idea whether in a specific sense.
[Caller] [1541.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1541.82s]: But I get
[Caller] [1544.18s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1544.48s]: the impression that nothing that
[Caller] [1545.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1545.58s]: she really said is original because
[Caller] [1547.78s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1547.78s]: as I said when I talked to this one guy he said
[Caller] [1549.72s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1549.76s]: that wasn't her people saying that thing before.
[Customer Service] [1552.14s]: But
[Caller] [1552.24s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1552.40s]: hers seem to have
[Caller] [1553.56s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1553.66s]: all the bits together in one place.
[Caller] [1555.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1556.00s]: And it seems to be reasonably rigorous.
[Caller] [1557.58s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1558.08s]: I mean, and it made sense.
[Caller] [1560.24s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1560.50s]: It was a good read.
[Caller] [1563.20s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1563.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1566.10s]: Indeed.
[Caller] [1567.64s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1569.78s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1571.00s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1571.82s]: I
[Caller] [1572.02s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1572.02s]: was in, what was it, Bram?
[Customer Service] [1574.20s]: No,
[Caller] [1574.38s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1574.56s]: no, no, no.
[Customer Service] [1575.50s]: Yeah, we were in.
[Caller] [1576.28s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1576.62s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1577.30s]: I was in.
[Caller] [1578.80s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1580.42s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1581.22s]: Was it
[Caller] [1581.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1581.54s]: any good or was it just so different then
[Caller] [1583.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1584.10s]: than what they write these days that was unrecognizable?
[Caller] [1587.84s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1588.13s]: That was pretty good.
[Caller] [1589.16s]: And actually what I thought was kind of interesting in the beginning and it actually continued throughout and was reasonably consistent was that I didn't know this.
[Caller] [1600.50s]: Have you ever read it?
[Customer Service] [1602.24s]: No, no.
[Caller] [1604.48s]: No.
[Caller] [1604.50s]: It's all written and a compilation of journal entries.
[Customer Service] [1609.52s]: Oh,
[Caller] [1609.74s]: So
[Customer Service] [1609.94s]: really?
[Caller] [1611.06s]: there are
[Customer Service] [1611.50s]: Oh,
[Caller] [1611.82s]: several characters in the book who are keeping journals explaining what they did that
[Customer Service] [1617.48s]: and then
[Caller] [1617.60s]: day.
[Customer Service] [1619.64s]: is it interspersed?
[Customer Service] [1620.68s]: So it goes like June 5th and then it's Joe's diary and Susan's diary and Frank's diary?
[Caller] [1625.64s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1626.66s]: Oh, wow.
[Caller] [1628.00s]: And so you follow along and you get different viewpoints on a few of the things.
[Caller] [1636.24s]: And something that he
[Customer Service] [1637.00s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1637.06s]: did that I think was probably pretty original at the time that
[Customer Service] [1641.50s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1641.78s]: Bram Stoker was writing was that all of the dialogue of all of the characters is very colloquial.
[Customer Service] [1649.80s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1650.00s]: And he
[Customer Service] [1651.66s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1653.04s]: goes out of his way to, you know, like
[Customer Service] [1656.50s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1656.92s]: when they go and talk to dock workers in London to
[Customer Service] [1662.00s]: Ah,
[Caller] [1662.36s]: spell things out phonetically so that you
[Customer Service] [1666.40s]: okay.
[Caller] [1667.18s]: sort of get to talk to the accent and
[Customer Service] [1669.28s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [1669.50s]: stuff.
[Caller] [1670.00s]: And when you read
[Customer Service] [1673.80s]: Right.
[Caller] [1673.92s]: Van Helsing's stuff,
[Customer Service] [1676.64s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1676.78s]: it's quite clear that English is not his first language.
[Caller] [1680.60s]: He's very educated, but he
[Customer Service] [1683.38s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1683.66s]: misuses grammar often and
[Customer Service] [1687.00s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1687.32s]: consistently throughout the entire book.
[Caller] [1690.76s]: Which is kind of interesting.
[Customer Service] [1691.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1693.06s]: So it was interesting in that way.
[Caller] [1695.42s]: And it
[Customer Service] [1697.10s]: Wow.
[Caller] [1697.66s]: was, for my liking,
[Customer Service] [1701.64s]: Wow.
[Caller] [1702.00s]: a little moralistic and heavy on the Christian motif.
[Customer Service] [1706.50s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1707.17s]: But it was a pretty good, true telling of the vampire myth.
[Customer Service] [1716.42s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1717.28s]: I mean, since much of the modern stuff is based directly on it,
[Customer Service] [1721.06s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1721.52s]: you'd hope that it was pretty much that.
[Caller] [1724.54s]: But it was interesting.
[Caller] [1727.10s]: I've
[Customer Service] [1727.30s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1728.06s]: actually been reading
[Customer Service] [1728.52s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1728.82s]: a lot of stuff along those lines recently because I started
[Customer Service] [1731.99s]: Oh,
[Caller] [1732.32s]: playing in a live action role playing game once a month.
[Customer Service] [1737.20s]: okay.
[Caller] [1737.42s]: It's
[Customer Service] [1737.43s]: Oh, okay.
[Caller] [1739.04s]: called Vampire the Masquerade.
[Caller] [1742.00s]: And
[Customer Service] [1743.04s]: Huh.
[Caller] [1743.12s]: it's actually...
[Customer Service] [1746.50s]: Where's the basis of it?
[Caller] [1748.56s]: Well, it's
[Customer Service] [1751.50s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1752.14s]: done by White Wolf Games.
[Caller] [1753.66s]: And they have basically
[Customer Service] [1757.12s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1757.34s]: designed a world in which vampires and werewolves and
[Customer Service] [1762.00s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1762.56s]: wraiths and mummies and such walk the world and are real.
[Caller] [1768.00s]: But
[Customer Service] [1768.40s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1768.82s]: the Masquerade is
[Customer Service] [1771.90s]: Hmm.
[Caller] [1772.20s]: a rigidly defined set of rules that vampires, for the most part, live under.
[Caller] [1778.10s]: And
[Customer Service] [1778.26s]: Exactly.
[Caller] [1778.70s]: the reason for the Masquerade is because they want humans to believe they don't exist.
[Customer Service] [1785.98s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1786.74s]: Because
[Customer Service] [1787.00s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1787.10s]: there are these minor problems that... Well, you find
[Customer Service] [1791.50s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1791.68s]: out when you read the histories in the game that, for instance, the
[Customer Service] [1796.56s]: Yeah.
[Caller] [1796.66s]: Inquisition was actually completely about vampires.
[Customer Service] [1801.50s]: Yeah.
[Customer Service] [1806.50s]: Yeah.
